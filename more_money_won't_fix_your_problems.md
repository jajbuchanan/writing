# More Money Won't Fix Your Problems

JBP: The emprical data suggests that once you have enough money that the debt collectors are off your back, which is basically at the upper end of the working class, or lower end of the middle class, more money has no effect whatsoever on your self-reported well-being, which is something like positive emotion and the absence of negative emotion. And maybe you think your life would be better with more money - and maybe it would be - but it wouldn't be as much better as you would hope. Because you'd still have the same problems most people have. Maybe you wouldn't get along with your sister, you'd still get divorced (and maybe you'd even be more likely to), and you'd still be beset with illnesses, and you'd still be stuck with the problem of what the hell your life is for, and what you're doing on the planet, and how to conduct yourself in the proper way.
